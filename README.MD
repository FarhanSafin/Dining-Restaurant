A restaurant scenario where there is a single cook. She can cook only one item at
a time and only when a waiter asks her to cook an item. The waiter requests a dish when a particular group of customers on a single table complete eating the last dish. 
The customers are foodies, so they keep eating new
dishes. Consequently, the waiter keeps asking the cook for a new dish, and the cook keeps cooking.  
This scenario is implemented using a multithreaded program with three different thread functions for the cook, waiter, and customers (each customer thread executes the same function).
